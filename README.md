### Project Overview
Designing and implementing a deep learning model that can precisely identify
colorectal cancer using medical images, such as colonoscopy, computed
tomography (CT), or histopathology images, is the main goal of this research. The
approach is expected to promote quick diagnosis, hence eliminating the necessity
for expensive operations, and enhancing patient outcomes.

### Problem Statement

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths
globally, with a significant portion of cases diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting
treatment options and survival rates. Despite advancements in screening
techniques and treatment modalities, there is still a pressing need to identify novel
biomarkers that can facilitate early detection, prognostication, and personalized
therapeutic interventions. According to the survey of American society, nearly 10%
of colorectal cancer increase in year of 2023 in United States.
The reason we're doing this is simple: we believe that with the help of these
computer programs, we can make a huge difference. They could help us detect
cancer much earlier than before. If we manage to do this, it means that treatment
can start earlier, which is often less complicated and more effective. In the end, this
could mean a lot of good news for people dealing with colorectal cancer â€“ giving
them a better fighting chance against the disease.
By the time we finish our project, we hope to have these computer programs up
and running, making them a reliable tool for doctors all over. It's about giving people
hope and better options when facing colorectal cancer and anyone interested in
this crucial area of healthcare.
